This is a learning project to implement a PNG image loader. Intended to use
with OpenGL for loading in object textures.

NOTES FOR THINGS I"VE LEARNED
- C++ binary file I/O, how to read in data from a file without needing it to
  be in ASCII. Here I used fstream, passed it the std::ios::binary flag, and
read the .get() output into an unsigned char in order to grab the data byte by
byte.

- <sys/stat.h>, this is part of the C standard. It's a header file that
  declares some functions which are implemented on a kernel level. For this
code I'm using it to get the size in bytes of the file before grabbing its
characters so that i can statically allocate the memory.

- Bitwise goodness, found a way to convert bytes extracted from file into an
  int by using bitwise operators | and <<. we "flash" the byte onto the bottom
8 bits and then shift em up so we can flash another.
